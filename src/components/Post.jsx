          <h1>üëã Hello, world!</h1>
          <h2>ü§ç About me</h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;m Cinthia, passionate about tech, information, and
            communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            My childhood was in a small city in Brazil, a peaceful place to
            live, which led me to grow and develop a special affection for
            technology.
          </p>

          <h2>üöÄ My Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a Front-end Developer, I have over three years of experience in
            creating user experiences for web applications that are
            user-friendly, responsive, and scalable. I am always eager to learn
            and improve skills, explore new challenges, and collaborate with
            others who share the passion and understanding for valuable purposes
            and good practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on projects, either in the
            health and financial industry, where I could further enhance my
            experience. My expertise lies in JavaScript, React, Angular,
            Material Design, and other front-end technologies and frameworks. I
            also have a solid background in Information and Communication
            Technologies, with a degree from the Federal University of Santa
            Catarina and an exchange program in Canada. I have a keen interest
            in the intersection of psychology, design, and technology, and how
            they influence human behavior and society.
          </p>

          <p>
            ü¶ã Additionally, I&apos;ve been polishing skills in problem-solving
            and assertive communication, increasing my understanding and
            perspectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            üêù I&apos;m passionate about research, collaboration, programming,
            and creativity!
          </p>
