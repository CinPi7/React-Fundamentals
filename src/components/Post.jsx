          <h1>üëã Hello, world!</h1>
          <h2>ü§ç About me</h2>
          <p>
            Im Cinthia, passionate about tech, information, and communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            My childhood was in a small city in Brazil, a peaceful place to
            live, which led me to grow and develop a special affection for
            technology.
          </p>

          <h2>üöÄ My Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a Front-end Developer, I have over three years of experience in
            creating user experiences for web applications that are
            user-friendly, responsive, and scalable. I am always eager to learn
            and improve skills, explore new challenges, and collaborate with
            others who share the passion and understanding for valuable purposes
            and good practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on projects, either in the health
            and financial industry, where I could further enhance my experience.
            My expertise lies in JavaScript, React, Angular, Material Design,
            and other front-end technologies and frameworks. I also have a solid
            background in Information and Communication Technologies, with a
            degree from the Federal University of Santa Catarina and an exchange
            program in Canada. I have a keen interest in the intersection of
            psychology, design, and technology, and how they influence human
            behavior and society.
          </p>

          <p>
            ü¶ã Additionally, I‚Äôve been polishing skills in problem-solving and
            assertive communication, increasing my understanding and
            perspectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            üêù Im passionate about research, collaboration, programming, and
            creativity!
